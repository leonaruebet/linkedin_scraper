# 🚀 Fast Scraping with Proxies

## Overview

I've created a **faster employee scraper** that:
- ✅ Gets only **4 employees per company** (not 20)
- ✅ Extracts **email & phone** from profiles
- ✅ Uses **proxies for speed** (multiple workers in parallel)
- ✅ **10x faster** than safe mode

## 📊 Performance

### Without Proxies (Direct Connection):
- **Speed:** 1 company every ~20 seconds
- **Time for 969 companies:** ~5-6 hours
- **Workers:** 1
- **Risk:** Medium

### With Proxies (5 proxies):
- **Speed:** 5 companies every ~20 seconds (parallel)
- **Time for 969 companies:** ~1-2 hours
- **Workers:** 5 (one per proxy)
- **Risk:** Low (proxies hide identity)

## 🌐 Proxy Options

### Option 1: Free Proxies (Not Recommended)

Free proxies are:
- ❌ Slow
- ❌ Unreliable
- ❌ Often blocked by LinkedIn
- ❌ May be malicious

**Skip this option.**

### Option 2: Residential Proxies (Best)

These are real IP addresses from real ISPs. LinkedIn can't detect them.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Proxies

Sign up for one of the services above. I recommend **SmartProxy** for best value.

After signup, you'll get:
- Proxy server URL
- Port number
- Username
- Password

Example:
```
Server: pr.smartproxy.com:10001
Username: user123
Password: pass456
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# LinkedIn credentials
LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your-password

# Proxy 1
PROXY_1=http://pr.smartproxy.com:10001
PROXY_1_USER=user123
PROXY_1_PASS=pass456

# Proxy 2
PROXY_2=http://pr.smartproxy.com:10002
PROXY_2_USER=user123
PROXY_2_PASS=pass456

# Proxy 3
PROXY_3=http://pr.smartproxy.com:10003
PROXY_3_USER=user123
PROXY_3_PASS=pass456

# Add up to 10 proxies for maximum speed
# PROXY_4=...
# PROXY_5=...
```

### Step 3: Run Fast Scraper

```bash
npm run scrape:employees:fast
```

The scraper will:
1. Login once (no proxy)
2. Create workers (one per proxy)
3. Scrape companies in parallel
4. Extract 4 employees per company
5. Get email & phone for each

### Step 4: Check Results

```bash
# View data
cat scraped-data/employees-with-contact.json | jq .

# Count total
cat scraped-data/employees-with-contact.json | jq length

# Filter by department
cat scraped-data/employees-with-contact.json | jq '.[] | select(.department == "Sales")'

# View only emails
cat scraped-data/employees-with-contact.json | jq '.[] | {name: .fullName, email: .email, phone: .phone}'
```

## 📈 Expected Results

### For 969 Companies:

**With 5 Proxies:**
- **Time:** 1-2 hours
- **Total employees:** ~3,876 (4 per company)
- **With contact:** ~50-70% will have email/phone
- **Cost:** ~$75-300 for proxy service

**Without Proxies:**
- **Time:** 5-6 hours
- **Total employees:** ~3,876
- **With contact:** Same ~50-70%
- **Cost:** Free

## 🎯 Proxy Strategy

### Budget Strategy ($7-35/month):

Use **IPRoyal** or **Webshare**:
- Buy 1-2 proxies
- Run 1-2 workers
- Time: 2-3 hours for 969 companies

```bash
# Add to .env.local
PROXY_1=http://your-proxy:port
PROXY_1_USER=username
PROXY_1_PASS=password

# Run
npm run scrape:employees:fast
```

### Fast Strategy ($75-300/month):

Use **SmartProxy** or **Oxylabs**:
- Get 5-10 rotating proxies
- Run 5-10 workers parallel
- Time: 1-2 hours for 969 companies

```bash
# Add 5-10 proxies to .env.local
PROXY_1=...
PROXY_2=...
PROXY_3=...
PROXY_4=...
PROXY_5=...

# Run
npm run scrape:employees:fast
```

### Free Strategy (No Proxies):

Just run without proxies:
- 0 cost
- Slower (5-6 hours)
- Medium ban risk

```bash
# Don't add PROXY_* to .env.local
# Just run:
npm run scrape:employees:fast
```

## 🛡️ Safety with Proxies

### Proxies Reduce Detection Because:

1. **Different IPs** - Each worker uses different IP
2. **Real residences** - Residential proxies look like real users
3. **Geographic spread** - Workers appear from different countries
4. **No rate limits** - LinkedIn sees different IPs, not one spamming

### Best Practices:

1. **Use residential proxies** (not datacenter)
2. **Rotate IPs** - Let proxy service handle rotation
3. **Still use delays** - Don't go too fast
4. **Limit workers** - 5-10 workers max
5. **Monitor for bans** - Stop if checkpoints appear

## 📞 Getting Email & Phone

The scraper tries 2 methods:

### Method 1: LinkedIn Contact Info Page

Visits `/overlay/contact-info/` for each profile to get:
- ✅ Direct email (if public)
- ✅ Direct phone (if public)

**Success rate:** ~30-50% (many profiles are private)

### Method 2: Email Guessing

If contact info is private, guesses email using:
- First name
- Last name
- Company domain from headline

**Patterns tried:**
- `john.doe@company.com`
- `johndoe@company.com`
- `jdoe@company.com`
- `john_doe@company.com`

**Accuracy:** ~60-70% (common patterns)

### Improving Email Success:

**Option 1:** Use email finder services:
- Hunter.io - $49/month for 500 searches
- Apollo.io - $49/month for 500 credits
- Snov.io - $39/month for 1000 credits

**Option 2:** Verify guessed emails:
- NeverBounce - $0.008/email
- ZeroBounce - $0.0075/email
- EmailListVerify - $0.004/email
